# Age Estimation Through Facial Detection 👤📊

## Description
Age Estimation Through Facial Detection is a computer vision–based project that detects human faces from images or video streams and predicts the approximate age of the detected person. The system uses **face detection techniques** combined with a **deep learning model** trained on facial features to estimate age accurately.

This project demonstrates the application of **machine learning, deep learning, and image processing** concepts in real-world scenarios such as surveillance systems, security, demographic analysis, and human–computer interaction.
